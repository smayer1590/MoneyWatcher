# MoneyWatcher
MoneyWatcher is a desktop application which uses C#, .NET and SQL database to show the summary of the money spent throughout the year.

This project gave me a opportunity to know how SQL can be used inside the application and more features will be included.

Although not done yet, a demo of the application can be found [Here](https://youtu.be/Sa9wR6GfsT8)
